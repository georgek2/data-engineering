'''
    Below are the reasons to which SyntaxError: (unicode error) ‘unicodeescape’ codec can’t 
    decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape occurs in Python:

    > Invalid Escape Sequences
    In this code, a file path is assigned to the variable file_path, but the backslashes 
    in the Windows file path should be escaped to avoid interpreting them as escape 
    sequences. Using backslashes in strings without properly escaping them or forming 
    valid Unicode escape sequences can trigger this error.

    > Truncated Escape Sequences
    In this code, the file path assigned to file_path contains a truncated escape sequence 
    (\U) which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
